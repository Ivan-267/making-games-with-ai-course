# AI 101 by Dr. Tommy Thompson

To better understand the theory behind classical AI in Games, the best resources to watch are the excellent **series of videos from Dr. Tommy Thompson on AI in Games called AI 101**.

[Dr Tommy Thompson](https://twitter.com/AIandGames) works as an AI developer, researcher and consultant in the video game industry. In his [YouTube channel AI and Games](https://www.youtube.com/@AIandGames), he studies what AI algorithms are used in games and how.

## Chapter 1: Navigation Meshes üó∫Ô∏è

In this first video, Dr Tommy Thompson takes a look at *navigation meshes*: what they are, how they work and how some AAA games exploit them in some pretty interesting ways.

## Chapter 4: Goal Oriented Action Planning üìù

In this chapter, Dr Tommy Thompson talks about a popular alternative to Behaviour Trees, *Goal Oriented Action Planning* (GOAP) which was **popularised by the AI of F.E.A.R.** and has been used in numerous games since.

## Chapter 5: Director AI for Balancing In-Game Experiences üì£

In this chapter, we take a look at *Director AI*: an approach popularised by Left 4 Dead for **balancing in-game experiences**.

## Chapter 6: Utility AI Helps NPCs Decide What To Do Next üìà

Sometimes the AI in a videogame has lots of perfectly valid actions it can take, **but deciding which one can be quite difficult**.

*Utility AI* is one approach to help solve it, by **calculating how useful that action is based on the current context**.

## Chapter 7: How Barks Make Videogame NPCs Look Smarter üó£Ô∏è

It **doesn't matter how intelligent your videogame AI is if the player doesn't understand it**. One of the simplest and most effective ways of communicating intelligence is simply to have it say what it thinks aloud -  a concept known in game development as a *'bark'*.  

That might sound pretty dumb, **but you'd be surprised how effective it is in practice**.

Now that we studed the theory behind these classical AI in Games algorithms. Let's **learn how to implement some of them in Unity and Unreal**.


## Chapter 8: How Machine Learning is Transforming the Video Games Industry ü§ñ

Artificial intelligence has been adopted in many ways in the games industry over the past 30 years, **but machine learning has never been considered practical until now**.  

In this episode of AI 101 Tommy discuss the fundamentals of what ML does, how it differs from traditional AI, what deep learning actually means, and the ways in which it is being put to good use in the industry.

## Chapter 10: How AI is Actually Used in the Video Games Industry (2024) ü§ñ

As AI becomes increasingly more involved in the development of video games, it's worth taking stock of just how many ways it can be used.  In this episode of AI 101 we dig into every facet of AI for games, and how it's actually being used in the industry.
