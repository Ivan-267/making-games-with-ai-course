# Classical AI in Games [[classical-ai-in-games]]

The goal of any **game is to be immersive**. In order to achieve this, **NPC must look smart**. They must be able to navigate correctly on the map (with ) and being able to take decisions.

In order to do that, the game industry developed multiple algorithms designs such as Navigation Mesh, Behavior Tree, Goal Action Oriented Planning and more.

Mastering these tools are important if you want to work on AI in games.

In this bonus unit, we're going to study classical AI in games. You'll learn about Navigation Meshes, Behavior Trees, Goal Action Oriented Planning, Finite State Machines and more.

In the first section, you'll learn the theory behind these algorithms, and then, in the next sections, you'll learn to implement these with Unreal or Unity.

So let's get started ðŸš€.
